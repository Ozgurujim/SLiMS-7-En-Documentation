SLiMS is web-based Open Source Software (OSS) developed to meet the requirements
 of web-based library automation, from small to large scale.
 Because it is full-featured and still actively developed, SLiMS is suitable
 for libraries that have varied collections, several staff members and a
 networked environment, whether local network (intranet) or the Internet.
 Another SLiMS feature is that it is multi-platform, which means it can
 run natively in almost all Operating Systems that support the programming
 language PHP(

SLiMS itself is developed on the platform of GNU / Linux and is running
 well on other platforms such as Unix * BSD and Windows.
 SLiMS is made up of web-based applications with cross-platform considerations
 and completely developed using Open Source Software, i.e : PHP Web Scripting
 Language, (

 To increase interactivity in such a desktop application, it also uses AJAX
 technology (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML).
 Senayan also uses Open Source Software to add features such as PhpThumb
 and SIMBIO ( a development platform developed from the project Igloo).

SLiMS version 1 and 2 were not released to the public because it was still
 being tested and was being refined.
 Since version 3, SLiMS has been considered stable enough to be released
 to the public and it is time-tested by the librarian community.
 Through peer-to-peer review by the public , SLIMS will become even more
 stable software and has more features that accommodating many needs.
