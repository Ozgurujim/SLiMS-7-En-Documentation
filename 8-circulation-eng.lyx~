\begin_layout Quote
An example of defining Loan Rules:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
In the library you have 3 types of collections: books, audiovisual (AV)
 and theses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
One type of membership your library has is : Student loans, with a total
 allowance of 2 items, namely: one item from the book collection and one
 more from the AV collection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For that you would need to create the membership type: "Students" , with
 total borrowing from two collections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
So, in Loan Rules this must be defined:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Member type "Student", borrowing allowance for collection="Book" is 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Member type "Student", borrowing allowance for collection="AV" is 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Member type "Student", borrowing allowance for collection="Thesis" is 0.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Quote
Everything must be defined, otherwise it can be exceeded.
